step 1: Define the Research Objectives
To developed a machine learning model for spam email detection that can effectively classify emails into "spam" or "non-spam" categories.
Step 2: Data Collection 
To gathered a comprehensive and labeled dataset of emails that includes both spam and non-spam emails for training and testing the model.
Step 3: Model Development and Training
To selected and implement appropriate machine learning algorithms  for email classification which ensures the accuracy of the spam email detection system.
Step 4: Evaluation and Validation
To conducted a qualitative analysis of misclassified emails to understand the model's strengths and weaknesses.
Step 5: Deployment and Practical Application
To created a user-friendly Python application or service for real-time spam email detection. To assess the model's performance in a real-world context, including its ability to adapt to new types of spam emails and its impact on reducing spam in an email system.
